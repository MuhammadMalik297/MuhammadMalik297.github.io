        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Predicting carbon emissions at a fine temporal granularity is key for
          energy planning and environmental policy. Our objective was to
          benchmark classical and neural network models on a highâ€‘resolution
          emissions dataset and quantify their predictive performance.
        </p>
        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>
          We curated hourly carbon emission data spanning multiple years and
          performed exploratory analysis to understand seasonality and trends.
          Traditional models such as ARIMA, SARIMA and support vector regression
          were compared against feedforward neural networks and LSTM models.
          Hyperparameters were tuned via crossâ€‘validation and forecasts were
          evaluated on sliding windows.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          The LSTM model achieved the lowest mean absolute error, outperforming
          classical approaches by up to 15%. However, simpler models like
          SARIMA performed competitively with far less training time. The work
          highlights the importance of strong baselines and transparent
          evaluation when applying deep learning to time series.
        </p>
        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
          Future extensions include incorporating exogenous variables (e.g.
          weather data), experimenting with transformerâ€‘based architectures and
          deploying the model as an API for realâ€‘time forecasting.
